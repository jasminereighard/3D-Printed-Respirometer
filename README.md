STL files for 3D printed respirometer chamber

Attached are the STL files for the 3D respirometer, along with printing instructions below.

This respirometer design is intended for intermittent-flow respirometry. The cone-bottom design helps keep sediments suspended during measurement cycles.

Here is a link to the filament we used.

To make the respirometers watertight, we used the print settings described below. 
Additionally, we coated the respirometers with this epoxy, thinned out with 90% rubbing alcohol.
